# QtQuoridor
My Qt implementation of the Quoridor game, using PySide2.

There are still a lot of things to do to perfect it (4 players, colors of the game, give names to players, ...), but it already works well for the time spent (4 days).

## Features
- Playable by two players, not four.
- Shows who's next to play ;
- Displays the number of remaining walls for each player ;
- Error messages are displayed when a player breaks a rule of the game ;
- Game screenshot.
